# ----------
# User Instructions:
#
# Implement the function optimum_policy2D below.
#
# You are given a car in grid with initial state
# init. Your task is to compute and return the car's
# optimal path to the position specified in goal;
# the costs for each motion are as defined in cost.
#
# There are four motion directions: up, left, down, and right.
# Increasing the index in this array corresponds to making a
# a left turn, and decreasing the index corresponds to making a
# right turn.

import time

forward = [[-1, 0],  # go up
           [0, -1],  # go left
           [1, 0],  # go down
           [0, 1]]  # go right
forward_name = ['up', 'left', 'down', 'right']

# action has 3 values: right turn, no turn, left turn
action = [-1, 0, 1]
action_name = ['R', '#', 'L']

# EXAMPLE INPUTS:
# grid format:
#     0 = navigable space
#     1 = unnavigable space
grid = [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]]

init = [4, 3, 0]  # given in the form [row,col,direction]
# direction = 0: up
#             1: left
#             2: down
#             3: right

goal = [2, 0]  # given in the form [row,col]

cost = [2, 1, 20]  # cost has 3 values, corresponding to making


# a right turn, no turn, and a left turn

# EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
# calling optimum_policy2D with the given parameters should return
# [[' ', ' ', ' ', 'R', '#', 'R'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', '#'],
#  ['*', '#', '#', '#', '#', 'R'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', ' '],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', ' ']]
